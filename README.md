# Guess Opening by [kesha](https://github.com/JustKesha)

This is a simple web-application that tests your knowledge of anime openings.<br>
The goal is to figure out the anime name by one of it's openings as fast as possible.

> [!NOTE]
> This idea was left on early in development and I currently don't plan on polishing it.<br>
> The core funcionality is there if you wanna try it out, you might wanna click on the background to start.<br>
> Some openings may not load as youtube blocks embeds for certain videos & I've not filtered those.
